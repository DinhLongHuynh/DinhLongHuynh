# Hi there, I'm Dinh Long Huynh! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I am on my way to become a **Cheminformatician**. My passion lies in the intersection of **Drug Discovery Modelling, Artificial Intelligence, and Computational Chemistry**. I specialize in applying **Explainability Techniques** to **ML Models** to interpret molecular predictions, making AI-driven drug discovery more transparent and trustworthy. I am fascinated by how **molecules can have a massive impact on human health**. My goal is to become an **expert in modeling**, helping teams make better, data-driven drug discovery decisions.


## 🔬 Research & Work Interests
- **Interpretable AI for Drug Discovery**: Applying LRP and other techniques to explain GNN-based models in the context of medicinal chemistry
- **PK-PD Modeling & Simulation**: Building PKPD pipeline to enhance automation.
- **Cheminformatics & Computational Chemistry**: Working with molecular fingerprints, docking, MD simulations, and structure-activity relationships (SAR).
